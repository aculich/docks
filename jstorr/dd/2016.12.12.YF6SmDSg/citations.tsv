10.2307/40212399	10.2307/40212399	Celluloid Love Songs: Musical "Modus Operandi" and the Dramatic Aesthetics of Romantic Hindi Film	Natalie Sarrazin	Popular Music	27	3	2008-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 393-411	Cambridge University Press	fla		In Hindi cinema, love songs comprise the vast majority in an industry in which almost every film contains song and dance numbers. Often incorrectly characterised as narrative interruptions, these celluloid creations contain indigenous aesthetics and self-identifying cultural values, and employ contemporary cinematic techniques which impact film song content and context. How do these cinematic techniques intensify the viewing experience and allow traditional aesthetic ideals to coexist with contemporary codes relevant to a burgeoning Indian middle class and diaspora? Beginning with an examination of traditional sources and contemporary values regarding music and emotion, I address the particularly important notion of displaying heart, often the centrepiece of thematic and dramatic tension as well as the love song soundtrack. As the primary emotional genre, I analyse the use of heart in romantic films and suggest a general typology of romantic film songs and their aesthetics, including commonly used musical motifs and codes. Finally, I compare musical, cinematic and narrative components of the Indian romantic genre with those aspects of the American film musical, particularly in relation to cultural values and ideological differences. The iconic use of a couple-centric narrative is examined in relation to Indian displays of emotion, and love song duets are contextualised through description of several pervasive cinematic techniques used to heighten the emotional impact of songs on the audience. I conclude with a focus on the relationship between the song sequence and the narrative structure, particularly how this serves to intensify the narrative flow rather than interrupt it.

Other modes of thought treat self-consciousness as constituted primarily by temporal desire. Rousseau raises love, for him the suspension of desire, to a position of ontological primacy in regard to self-consciousness. Like Pascal, he throws the empirical existence of the self into radical question and finds it to be as insubstantial and empty a concept as the Western tradition has found it-from Ecclesiastes and Socrates on. Rousseau declines the moralistic reproof of the self, however, and emphasizes its insubstantiality as its one strength, although a fictional one. The self exists only in the mode of a hypothesis (the fictional "as if"): it is a failure at being. But to amour (and to pitié) it makes all the difference and is worthy of their support.

The present paper addresses itself to this latter point of money-orientedness. Presenting data from a 1973 national survey, the findings support the idea that semi-skilled and unskilled workers place a greater emphasis on money than do other occupational levels. Differences in emphasis on the importance of money are not explained when income is used as a covariate. A part of these differences is explained by education. When both education and income are controlled, differences between occupational levels vanish except for the difference between the semi-skilled/unskilled and all other levels. The findings tend to support Form's hypothesis of the "internal stratification of the working class" with increasing industrialization.

We might respond by bringing the voice of the narrator, and Beckett's narrative in general, into contact with the major theorizer of dialogue, Mikhail Bakhtin. Bakhtin's categories of genre suggest that Beckett's story may share strategic affinities with the menippea, while his concept of chronotope helps to clarify some of the contradictory details in the text. It is the idea of dialogue, however, with its implied surrender of power to the other that dominates the text and obsesses the narrator. In illuminating the narrator's resistance to, and regretful acknowledgement of his dialogic position in the world, Bakhtin's words respond to and renew Beckett's.

Drive and Desire in Twentieth-Century Harmony: the Erotics of Skryabin	KENNETH SMITH	Music Analysis	29	1/3	2010-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 234-263	Wiley	fla		Leonid Sabaneyev attested that Skryabin's compositions contained within them 'a science of tonal love', and Skryabin himself described his two Op. 57 pieces - Désir and Caresse dansée - as 'new ways of making love'. But what makes this music so erotic in nature? The composer theorised about the nature of desire and sexuality in his writings, but this discussion rarely spills over into analysis of his compositional system. Given that Skryabin was so steeped in psychology throughout his life, I appeal to the work of Freud and Jacques Lacan, and particularly to their distinction between drive and desire (essentially, the fundamental instinct of the id versus its imaginary representation), a distinction found in Skryabin's own philosophical writings. But the progression between these two states bears comparison with both his philosophy and his harmonic processes, and I thus focus on the function of the dominant chord, exploring ways in which it can replicate the structures of drive and desire. In so doing, I scrutinise several piano miniatures to show that part of Skryabin's method of embodying drive in music lays out ambiguous chord structures which bear simultaneous tendencies to move in a number of different directions, as multivalent as the drive in the human subject. Further, I attempt to show that, out of mystical sonorities, Skryabin temporally unfolds a dialogue of different dominant ' drives', and eventually selects and nurtures a single one at the expense of others, a motion equivalent to desire.

Using a later edition of Boswell, he began a fresh set of notes about a new idea for a play about the odd characters living in Johnson's house. The influence of Dr. Johnson and of Jeremy Taylor's Rules and Exercises of Holy Living and Dying on Beckett is shown to be so deep that it pervades Beckett's work.

Beaty	PMLA	83	2	1968-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 429-438	Modern Language Association	fla		Though Burns enunciated no critical precepts on the comedy of love, he composed much of his best poetry not only within the eighteenth-century sanction of aggressive wit but also according to the tradition of humor as it later became associated with the distinctively Romantic expression of the comic spirit. Illustrative poems and letters reveal his mirthful delineation of human affection. With extraordinary insight into the realities of amatory experience, he treated a rich variety of subjects-the multifarious joys and problems of courtship, unrestrained passion, adultery, unwed parenthood, marriage, artificial conventions and morals, alcoholic stimulation, and defiance of social hypocrisy. His sympathy with the essential seriousness of love counterbalanced a perceptive awareness of human frailties; his basically empathic approach to the dilemmas of love often coalesced with portrayals of ludicrous situations or character traits that invited laughter. It was the fusion of these seemingly antithetical elements that impressed his nineteenth-century admirers, and this outstanding achievement has become increasingly significant in the light of more recent psychological analyses.

In this paper, we assess how organization theory and empirical research have thus far responded to this tension over corporate involvement in wider social life. Organizational scholarship has typically sought to reconcile corporate social initiatives with seemingly inhospitable economic logic. Depicting the hold that economics has had on how the relationship between the firm and society is conceived, we examine the consequences for organizational research and theory by appraising both the 30-year quest for an empirical relationship between a corporation's social initiatives and its financial performance, as well as the development of stakeholder theory. We propose an alternative approach, embracing the tension between economic and broader social objectives as a starting point for systematic organizational inquiry. Adopting a pragmatic stance, we introduce a series of research questions whose answers will reveal the descriptive and normative dimensions of organizational responses to misery.

America's traditional commitment to open markets is now buffeted by both left and right, from labor unions and environmentalists to big business and "America First" isolationists. Fortunately, the advent of the World Trade Organization offers Washington a chance to balance the protectionist threat. If the United States cooperates with the WTO to settle trade disputes multilaterally, it can dilute both protectionist pressure at home and anti-American resentment abroad. But robust leadership and commitment will be needed, and neither Congress nor President Clinton seems up to the task.

Considering EPA study design and statistical methods used in data interpretation, we have reservations regarding the conclusions drawn from the study by the EPA and others. Our reservations focus mainly on the high likelihood of achieving only low power for detecting differences in chemical prevalence between the three sampling areas identified in the study. It is our conclusion that no decision can be reached concerning habitability of this area until a more comprehensive study is completed.

Taxes, however, have been largely overlooked as a determinant of marriage, even though the tax system in the United States is not marriage-neutral; that is, when two individuals marry, their marital income tax burden is typically different-sometimes higher, sometimes lower-than their combined single income tax obligations. In this paper we explore the impact of the federal individual income tax, as well as other economic and demographic variables, on the marriage decisions of individuals. Using longitudinal data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics for the period 1968-92, we estimate a discrete-time hazard model of the time to first marriage. We find that the probability of marriage is significantly affected by a range of economic and demographic variables. Importantly, we find that an increase in total income taxes paid by married versus single women has a negative effect on the likelihood of marriage, and that the change in the marginal tax rate is also a significant determinant of marriage in some cases; in contrast, the tax effects are rarely significant in determining marriage probabilities among men, although there are some differential responses by race. In general, the impacts of the income tax variables, even when statistically significant, are small.

At the core of the phenomenon is a juxtaposition of public and private embodied in both the character of Lucy and her creator, the popular public woman Lucille Ball. A textual reading of the episode "Lucy Does a TV Commercial" in the contexts of other aspects of the Lucy phenomenon (Ball's public persona, audience knowledge of the "real" marriage of Ball and Arnaz), and other popular articulations of gender and middle-class life in the postwar era suggests how the Lucy phenomenon was framed by and broke the frames of commodification. Overall, the series offers consumption as the solution to Lucy's dissatisfaction, an example of the consumerist-ethos that presented private solutions to public problems. However, at the same time that the phenomenon participated in the mass consumer economy, the show's comedy played on conflicts and anxieties about consumption and domesticity.

Yet not only Kant, but numerous scholars of Natural law in the 18th and 19th centuries refer to and reflect on the juridical aspects of Mendelssohn's work, in particular his thoughts on the law of contract. In this article, I hope to shed some light on this hitherto rather unexplored facet of Mendelssohn's oeuvre. Mendelssohn develops his theory of contract from the starting point of the officium amoris: the unenforceable 'duty of love' to exercise beneficence. Mendelssohn's theory knows nothing yet of the modern contrast between altruism, distributive justice and 'freedom of contract'. By exploring Mendelssohn's theory, we will thus be able to catch a glimpse of the birth pangs of the modern Western discourse on the 'freedom of contract', which formed the backdrop as well as the jumping-off point of the development of a 'liberal' will theory of contract. Since this 'liberal' model is still the paradigm of how contract is mostly perceived today, Mendelssohn's theory also exemplifies the possibility of an alternative to our own conceptualizations of contract that inescapably shape the way we think.

Based on ethnographic research in Hebei villages, this article examines different types of gendered subjectivity that lead some rural women to make fatal decisions. Suicidal behavior is an important form of female agency that asserts rural women’s moral aspiration for freedom and individual rights, but this form of agency does not highlight their ability to resist. Rather, it points to their powerless positions in the community. From these findings, I argue that neither the concept of resistance nor that of subjection can properly represent the complex realities and inner voices of rural women who attempt suicide.

Vollmann's novels are devoted to the interrogation of 'America,' which ultimately questions the American 'I' in the present time. A constant insight running through Vollmann's work is that this American self is not so much a free individual as a formation in power relationships. In short, Vollmann constitutes the self in the present as the doppelganger of 'America.' Reflecting this inquiry, his 1996 book The Atlas brings together the numerous fragments of an American world traveler's experiences. The nameless traveler always finds himself in asymmetrical relations with the 'other,' typically monetary relations with women in the Third World. In the age of globalization, the American self emerges out of the whole atlas. Yet, The Atlas rejects any optimistic gestures of Americanism: numerous scenes of violence and lines of difference run through the map, defining the position of the traveler where, against all idealism, he discovers himself to be a wretched white man scattering his desire and cash across the globe. In the post-Cold War era of Americanism, Vollmann's atlas converts any optimistic view of the self into its negative double, an intolerable man in the map of power relationships. The Vollmannian doppelganger reveals the unbearable weight of being American.

El ejemplo más conocido será Les Femmes savantes de Molière, pero también pertenece a la misma categoría El desdén contra el desdén de Moreto. Desestimado y poco estudiado, El amor médico de Tirso suscitó juicios negativos de parte de sus pocos críticos debido a la errónea suposición que su protagonista Doña Jerónima es una bachillera hóstil a los hombres, al amor, y al matrimonio, que traiciona su inteligencia persiguiendo, cautivando y por fin casándose con Don Gaspar. Contrariamente a esta opinión, se puede demostrar que el amor es efectivamente la base filosófica de la comedia, que vincula los sentimientos con la razón, la sabiduría con las pasiones, la mujer con el hombre. El sublime agente de este eslabonamiento es la misma Doña Jerónima quien, partiendo de lo sexual, pasa a masculinas figuraciones mentales para encumbrarse en una hyperfanía amorosa que encierra en sí la intelectualidad y la sexualidad como grados que elevan los amantes al Parnaso. Es Doña Jerónima la cónyuge de la obra. Une en ella pares de términos aparentemente opuestos, la ciencia de la medicina con el amor, mediando entre ellos y traduciéndose en ellos. Representa en su plenitud la entera acción metafórica de la comedia.

Because bettors willingly accept low‐return, high‐variance bets, researchers conclude that bettors are risk lovers. In this study, we show that the data are at least as consistent with risk aversion as they are with risk loving when one explicitly considers the skewness of bet returns. Because the variance and skewness of bet returns are highly correlated, bettors may appear to prefer variance when it is skewness that they crave.

Body and soul remain at odds within a person until he loves another person, for the reason that his soul realizes and knows itself through the experience of love, love being a state in which flesh, become subordinate or servant to the psyche, terminates its suppression of soul. During love, the soul is ecstatically freed from the body, transplanted into a richer soil, which is the soul of the other person, and thereby gains new strength and a knowledge about itself in relation to its body. When at the termination of love's ecstasy, the soul repairs to its body, the self is no longer a merely carnal or physical being, but a synthesis permitted by love's potentiation of the soul.

Nonetheless, representative information about young adults' sexual activities in long-term relationships and the emotional context of such relationships is rare. Methods: A subsample of 6,421 participants in Wave 3 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (18-26-year-olds) who were in a sexual relationship of at least three months' duration were selected for analysis. Multiple logistic regression models were used to explore the relationship between love and various sexual activities. Results: Eighty percent of respondents had engaged in cunnilingus and fellatio as well as vaginal intercourse in their current relationship; this group included 22% who also had engaged in anal sex. Compared with their peers who reported that they and their partner did not love each other a lot, both males and females who reported mutually loving relationships had significantly higher odds of having given oral sex (odds ratios, 3.9 and 2.6, respectively) and having received oral sex (1.8 and 3.3); males in mutually loving relationships also had elevated odds of having had anal sex (3. 1). Conclusions: Most young adult couples in long-term relationships engage in a variety of sexual practices with loving partners; the direction of causality in this association and its implications for relationship building require exploration. Furthermore, programs and interventions that address health and well-being during emerging adulthood should cover issues relevant to a broad range of sexual activities, including oral and anal sex.

She melds a postmodern experimentation with a gendered sense of identity, focussing on the fragmented self not just as a reaction against the constraints of a realist narrative, but as an opportunity to explore multiplicity and artistic agency. The principal focus of this essay is on Anagrams, a collection of linked short stories that has also been marketed as a novel. Anagrams offers a metafictional recycling of the alternative "stories" of the central character's life. This may be Moore's most overt play on masquerade and (re)invention, but, as will be explored, her oeuvre is suffused with women characters who attempt a variety of escapes from their presumed narrative closures and who also struggle with feminism and its consequent impact on their narrated lives. Moore admirably captures the angst attached to narrative disappointment; the desire for replication, reinvention and a shifting of responsibility; and the problematic landscape of feminism for her mature and maturing women characters. This essay explores Moore's fictional(ized) feminism and postfeminism and her characters' resort to masquerade as a legitimate response to contemporary angst and narrative tension.

The swarming flights are mainly performed by males whereas most of the females stay within the host trees and continue feeding. Males orientate towards damage-induced green leaf volatiles (GLV) allowing location of mechanically damaged foliage. In order to distinguish between unspecific leaf damage and damage caused by feeding females, male cockchafers orientate by a sex attractant. Here we show this compound to be 1,4-benzoquinone, which has been known for more than 40 years as a highly effective defence compound used by numerous arthropod species to repel enemies. 1,4-benzoquinone synergistically increased the number of males caught in GLV-baited funnel traps during the swarming period. Significantly more males landed on wire cages baited with a combination of 1,4-benzoquinone and GLV than on cages baited with only GLV. The results suggest that the sex pheromone of M. hippocastani might have evolved from a primary role as a defence compound.

She argues that Socrates there attributes two incompatible positions to Diotima, who in any case is not present at the banquet. The first is that love is a mid-point or intermediary between lovers which also teaches immortality. The second is that love is a means to the end and duty of procreation, and thus is a mere means to immortality through which the lovers lose one another. Irigaray argues in favor of the first position, a conception of love as demonic intermediary. E.K.

The central role of the brother/sister relationship in the reproduction of Arab patriarchy, as a result, has been missed, misconstructed, or underestimated. This article argues that Arab brothers and sisters in Borj Hammoud, Lebanon, developed connective relationships based on love and nurturance, while paradoxically also based on power and violence. These dynamics were manifested psychodynamically, social structurally, and culturally. Connectivity, love, and power underwrote the central role played by the brother/sister relationship in the reproduction of Arab patriarchy.

According to OPC, the relevant domain for a quantified sentence is determined by objective facts of the context of utterance. In contrast, according to IPC, we must consider certain features of the speaker's intention in order to determine the proposition expressed. My goal is to offer a plausible and fair reconstruction of IPC. Drawing a parallel between quantifier domain restriction and standard cases of context dependence as indexicality, I argue that the speaker's intentions can play a semantic role only if they satisfy an Availability Constraint: an intention must be made available or communicated to the addressee, and for that purpose the speaker can exploit any feature of the objective context (words, gestures, relevance or uniqueness of either the quantificational domain or of the referent in the context of utterance). An intention satisfying the Availability Constraint must be something that a hearer in normal circumstances is able to work out by relying on the physical surroundings of the utterance situation, on utterances exchanged during the previous conversation, and on background knowledge shared by speaker and addressee.

The aim of the project was to look for similarities and differences between the thinking and practice of caregiving to children and the related but distinct type of caring labor that adult daughters provide for their frail, elderly mothers. Support was found for the theory that adult daughters preserve their aging mothers' lives, foster their growth, and try to help their mothers remain acceptable to society. Implications for family and gerontological practitioners from a feminist analysis of parental caregiving are discussed.

Today's women are said to be wayward and troublesome, defying their husbands in pursuit of other men's love and money. Yet, many women maintain marriages in which there is no love and no money. And for those who do leave, remarriage offers little attraction: neither for love nor for money. In this article, I explore the interplay between love and money in intimate relationships in Ado-Odo and implications for the ways in which gender and agency are construed and enacted in everyday life.

Deux séries de déterminations, au moins, concourent à la production de la littérature: celles d'ordre psychique, celles d'ordre socio-historique, le texte apparaissant à l'articulation de ces deux chaînes. Du point de vue de l'analyse de l'idéologie comme agent organisateur de l'œuvre, Love Story est un champ d'expérience intéressant. Derrière l'histoire d'amour, s'y découvre une structure d'agression, les raisons de ce désir de destruction se révélant être des éléments de l'histoire contemporaine.

Elementary-school children's conceptions of parental control in terms of helping, monitoring, decision making, and praising were assessed with self-report methods as were children's conceptions of ability, perceptions of the frequency of parental control, and self-esteem. With grade, children increasingly viewed parental helping, monitoring, and decision making as indicative of incompetence. Older children also viewed parental praising as motivated by parents' desire to promote competence. These conceptions of parental control were associated with conceptions of ability. Children's conceptions of parental helping, monitoring, and decision making moderated the relation between their perceptions of the frequency with which parents exerted control and their self-esteem.

Although he is now often unnoticed, history has attested to Beecher's influence on important elements of contemporary rhetorical style and homiletic theology. In his largest pronouncement on the theory of preaching, his Yale lectures, Beecher set out a theory of preaching that declared the goal of preaching to be a core transformation of the listeners through an aesthetic connection to the Divine presence. As a part of this process, Beecher argued in favor of an ecumenically Christian form of "taste" that would sensitize the audience to the existence of a new kind of knowledge: a divinely inspired linkage of logos and pathos that Beecher referred to as the Doctrine of Love.

After discussing the main mechanisms that could account for trends in age differences, we show that age differences between spouses narrowed considerably between 1850 and 1970. After 1970 the trend becomes less clear-cut.

Drawing partly on the work of George Orwell, and partly on the life and work of Simone Weil, as well as on further material, I argue that Gaita's use of this notion to help make sense of the concept of human preciousness is unconvincing, not least because he does not properly explore the figure and psychology of the saint in any detail. I relatedly argue that the notion of human preciousness in question is implausible and, in some ways, sentimental. I also explore Gaita's concept of " speaking personally" in moral philosophy, and suggest that matters here are a great deal more complicated than he supposes.

Gershoff, Ashesh Mukherjee, Anirban Mukhopadhyay	Marketing Letters	17	2	2006-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 103-117	Springer	fla		Consumers often interact with agents to obtain advice about products and services. A consumer's evaluation of an agent as a source of personalized advice depends, in part, on the extent to which the consumer believes the agent knows and shares her tastes. In this research, we show a positivity effect in the agent evaluation process, whereby consumers perceive alternatives they love (compared to hate) to be more informative to agents about their tastes, and hence more diagnostic to agents for predicting their future evaluations. Further, we show that this positivity effect is moderated by the agent's level of agreement with the consumer, and is driven by the greater accessibility of information about loved, compared to hated, alternatives. We discuss the implications of these results for interpersonal judgments and agent choice.

Gordon	Gender and Society	2	3	1988-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 308-342	Sage Publications, Inc.	fla		Throughout the twentieth century, women's magazines in the United States have socialized their readers to the "proper" expression of love and anger in marriage. Our analysis of a random sample of marital advice articles from 1900 to 1979 examines this cultural convergence of gender, marriage, and emotion. A qualitative analysis identifies techniques for socializing readers to the emotional culture of marriage and shows a historical change toward equating love with self-fulfillment and advocating the expression of anger. A quantitative analysis then specifies the timing of changes in emotion norms and showed an oscillation between modern and traditional norms that is related to waves of political liberation versus oppression. We discuss the relation between emotion norms and behavior and explore the effect of group conflict on the production of emotional culture. Emotion norms have become less rigid and more tolerant of diversity; but gender differences persist, and women are still responsible for maintaining intimate relationships. Historical trends in love and anger norms are nonlinear, not a continuous shift toward individualism, self-development, and free expression, as suggested by recent cultural theories.

They participate in the construction of cultural identies from that in-between space and stage many of the concerns of contemporary translation theory. I call such texts translational literature. While all bilingual and multilingual discourse dramatizes the interaction of languages, translational texts lay special emphasis on translation as an essential component of cross-cultural contact. As such, translational literature treats translation in several registers-formal, thematic, linguistic, and discursive-raising questions not only about technical aspects of linguistic transfer but also about cultural (un)translatability, discourses of difference, and ideologies of domination. This essay elaborates the notion of translational literature and offers the exemplary case of Ahdaf Soueif's "The Map of Love" (1999).

Steen	Poetics Today	23	1	2002-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 91-122	Duke University Press	fla		Given her influential and decidedly liberal feminist social agenda, Aphra Behn's political convictions during the struggles of the 1680s between Parliament and Charles II have struck several critics as incongruously reactionary. This essay proposes a partial resolution to this apparent contradiction by examining how Behn employs the psychology of transgressive love to model the relation between the king and his subjects. By drawing selectively from the different sets of inferences present in the conceptual spaces of passionate love and autocratic power, Behn produces an unstable but potent conceptual blend. The emerging "liberal royalism" is driven by desire and characterized by an emotionally irresistible reciprocal attachment.

Boccaccio presents an affair he thinks perfect, and the salient feature is that love paramours is to be preferred to marriage precisely because it affords a sensuousness marriage cannot. Its very immorality is what makes it an alto appetito. Pandaro justifies Troilo's love on the grounds that his is a desire too intense to be satisfied onestamente. Criseida's principal argument for engaging in a clandestine love is that the restricted conditions for such a love produce a greater intensity of desire than the free access provided by marriage, and her culminating argument for acquiescence in her exchange is that the alternative of eloping would remove the restriction which keeps Troilo's desire so intense. Criseida's infidelity is not presented as due to her being too sensual to be steadfast but as due to her possession of a fickleness often found in young women.

Titelbaum	Philosophical Studies: An International Journal for Philosophy in the Analytic Tradition	149	1	2010-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 119-134	Springer	fla		Recent discussion of Vogel-style "bootstrapping" scenarios suggests that they provide counterexamples to a wide variety of epistemological theories. Yet it remains unclear why it's bad for a theory to permit bootstrapping, or even exactly what counts as a bootstrapping case. Going back to Vogel's original bootstrapping example, I note that an agent who could gain justification through the method Vogel describes would have available a "no-lose investigation": an investigation that can justify a proposition but has no possibility of undermining it. The main suggestion of this article is that an epistemological theory should not permit no-lose investigations. I identify necessary and sufficient conditions for such investigations, then explore epistemological theories that rule them out. If we want to avoid both skepticism and no-lose investigations, we must eschew either Closure or epistemic externalism.

Along with a number of other scholars, this paper suggests that the intensive focus on that question, despite its undeniable scholarly and constitutional interest, has led to a tendency to overlook or ignore many of the crucial ways in which foreign law has entered and influenced U.S. law and policy. Using the example of the European Union's Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), this paper examines the ways in which individual states and a wide range of private actors, including NGOs, have drawn upon and used EU law in reforming the U.S. chemicals regime. The paper tells a story of law's migration, highlighting the impact that foreign law can have in the United States and identifying the routes it travels to find its way in. It argues that this regulatory influence is not one way and that the EU regime is structured in such a way that reciprocal learning from the United States is also highly likely.

Tripp, Renaud Legoux	Journal of Marketing	73	6	2009-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 18-32	American Marketing Association	fla		This article explores the effects of time and relationship strength on the evolution of customer revenge and avoidance in online public complaining contexts. First, the authors examine whether online complainers hold a grudge—in terms of revenge and avoidance desires—over time. They find that time affects the two desires differently: Although revenge decreases over time, avoidance increases over time, indicating that customers indeed hold a grudge. Second, the authors examine the moderation effect of a strong relationship on how customers hold this grudge. They find that firms' best customers have the longest unfavorable reactions (i.e., a longitudinal love-becomes-hate effect). Specifically, over time, the revenge of strong-relationship customers decreases more slowly and their avoidance increases more rapidly than that of weak-relationship customers. Third, the authors explore a solution to attenuate this damaging effect—namely, the firm offering an apology and compensation after the online complaint. Overall, they find that strong-relationship customers are more amenable to any level of recovery attempt. The authors test the first two issues with a longitudinal survey and the third issue with a follow-up experiment.

If a child is sure of affection and interest which remain constant regardless of his successes or failures, he will retain a positive attitude toward learning.

According to Barthes, love narratives are the effect of "gossip" third person counterfeits of a discourse of desire that in its purest form can only be addressed by a first to a second person. As the pronoun of gossip, the third person is the "wicked pronoun". Shakespearean drama displays the dialectics of lover, s discourse and love story, the contrast between a discourse of desire and a discourse about others, desires. This contrast is registered in the transformation of a referential universe which exhausts itself in "I" and "you" (the lover's) into forms of discourse where the lover becomes "he" or "she", a "theme" rather than the subject of desire. Shakespeare constructs a heroics of love whose main feature is the lovers, resistance to be narrated by others. But this resistance usually ends up in the lovers, final yielding to thirdperson narratives, sometimes told by others, sometimes by themselves. The analysis of pronominal forms in Twelfth Night (1601), Troilus and Cressida (1602), and Anthony and Cleopatra (1607) constitutes the basis for a wider concern with the effects of third-person narratives upon the shaping of erotic identity in these plays.

This article examines this paradox of term limit support among two groups of knowledgeable observers-party chairs and lobbyists in Florida. The findings sup the idea that to know term limits is NOT to love them. They also suggest that among these political elites, support for the repeal of term limits is not a matter of self-interest, but rather reflects a concern about the institutional viability of an important state representative body.

Building on research on (bodily) feeling-as-information and embodied cognition, we hypothesize that physical coldness activates a need for psychological warmth, which in turn leads to an increased liking for romance movies. Four laboratory experiments and an analysis of online movie rental data provide support for our hypothesis. Specifically, studies 1A and 1B show that physical coldness increases the liking of and willingness to pay for romance movies. Study 2 shows that the effect of physical coldness on liking of romance movies only occurs for people who associate romance movies with psychological warmth. Study 3 shows that people correct for the influence of physical coldness on their liking of romance movies when physical coldness is made salient. In study 4, using data on online movie rentals and historical temperature, we found a negative relationship between weather temperature and preference for romance movies.

This study uses interviews with prostitutes' clients to show how commodity exchange can be understood as being morally superior to gift exchange. The interviewees praise "market exchange" of sex for lacking the ambiguity, status-dependence, and potential hypocrisy that they see in the "gift exchange" of sex characteristic of romantic relationships. This justification of market exchange suggests that theories of the "moral economy" that posit a dichotomy between "premarket" and "market" societies understate the degree to which market societies are, for their participants, also moral economies: they are economies embodying moral beliefs about individual autonomy, democratic equality, and unambiguous and nondiscretionary fulfillment of obligations. Critics of the market do themselves a disservice in ignoring the powerful moral appeals of market exchange. More generally, sociological analyses that pit "norms" against "self-interest" ignore the ways in which norms can enable as well as constrain self-interested market behavior. /// [Spanish] La prostitución como práctica cultural traza la línea entre lo que se tiene que dar como un regalo y lo que se tiene que dar a cambio como producto; por lo que una investigación de la prostitución puede ser una ulterior comprención del apuntalamiento ideológico del intercambio de producto. Este trabajo se basa en entrevistas con clientes de prostitutas para demostrar cómo el cambio de producto puede ser entendido como moralmente superior que el cambio del regalo. Los entrevistados elogian "el mercado de cambio" de sexo por carecer de ambiguedad, dependencia de estatus, e hipocrecía potencial que ellos ven el el "intercambio de regalo" de las características de sexo de las relaciones románticas. Esta justificación del cambio de mercado sugiere que las teorías de la "economía moral" postulan una dicotomía entre el "pre-mercado" de sociedades y el "mercado" de sociedades que subestima el grado del cual el mercado de sociedades son, para sus participantes, también las economías morales: son economías que materializan creencias morales acerca de la autonomía moral, igualdad democrática y una satisfacción de obligaciones sin ambiguedad y sin discriminación. Críticos del mercado se perjudican ellos mismos al ignorar los fuertes Ilamamientos morales del mercado de cambio. Generalmente, el análisis sociológico que se opone a las "normas" en contra del "auto-interés" ignora las formas en las cuales las normas pueden habilitar, así como también reprimir un comportamiento autointeresado de mercado. /// [Chinese] (Unicode for Chinese abstract). /// [Japanese] (Unicode for Japanese abstract).

Neil Macrae	Psychological Science	16	3	2005-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 236-239	Association for Psychological Science, Sage Publications, Inc.	fla		Gaze direction is a vital communicative channel through which people transmit information to each other. By signaling the locus of social attention, gaze cues convey information about the relative importance of objects, including other people, in the environment. For the most part, this information is communicated via patterns of gaze direction, with gaze shifts signaling changes in the objects of attention. Noting the relevance of gaze cues in social cognition, we speculated that gaze shifts may modulate people's evaluations of others. We investigated this possibility by asking participants to judge the likability (Experiment 1) and physical attractiveness (Experiment 2) of targets displaying gaze shifts indicative of attentional engagement or disengagement with the participants. As expected, person evaluation was moderated by the direction of gaze shifts, but only when the judgment under consideration was relevant to participants. We consider how and when gaze shifts may modulate person perception and its associated behavioral products.

Despite some very good individual efforts, they have had little effect on the design and implementation of development projects, partly because of the dominant emphasis on economic growth. Congress has recently mandated a radical shift in the conventional development paradigm toward emphasis on social equity and participation of poor people in their own development, thus increasing the importance of social factors in project design and implementation. This new emphasis provides significant new opportunities to anthropologists, but substantial changes are still necessary both among anthropologists and A I D officials if these opportunities are to be realized.

As such, it is preoccupied with cross-cultural, cross-national, inter-religious, and inter-lingual relations. Aspiring to move from one geographical and cultural setting to another—from the poverty-stricken Eastern-European Jewish town to the promisingly rich and excitingly modern "New World" of North America—the characters, and to some extent also their author, Sholom Aleichem, are busy disparaging their former world and idealizing the new. The translation of the novel into English by Tamara Kahana (published 1953) augments this dynamics in its attempt to assimilate the work to the American canon and reduce its Jewishness. Kahana, being both a Jewish immigrant herself and the author's grandchild, is an involved translator. Rather than an act of mediation and communication, her strategy of translation appears to be an act of appropriation, a rewriting whereby the otherness of the source text is erased. At issue here—for all three agencies that deliver Mottel's story to us (the narrator Mottel, the authorial voice, and the translator)—is an ideal of identity that involves a break with the past. For Mottel and for Sholom Aleichem this ideal is America and the formation of an assimilated American identity; for Kahana it is a perfectly accessible Americanized story. However, in both the original text and in its translation, this ideal is continually subtly subverted, even as it is strenuously articulated and sought.¹

Often seen as an early proponent of racial antisemitism, Arnim in fact vacillates between fascination with and rejection of Jews and Judaism. I show how his ambivalence proliferates around the motif of inter-religious love in texts such as "Über die Kennzeichen des Judenthums," "Die Versöhnung in der Sommerfrische," and "Die Majorats-Herren". Drawing on psychoanalytically inflected theories of ideology by Slavoj Žižek and Homi Bhabha, I suggest that ambivalence may render antisemitic ideology all the more effective rather than temper it. In both his speeches and his literary texts, Arnim's dramatization of Jewish-Gentile sex and love tends to disavow the tensions inherent in his visions of social harmony.

I suspect that I am more honored to give this talk than most past presidents of the Association, given my current academic post in California. I may be far removed from my southern heritage in space, but not in orientation. My heart remains tied to the South. I am very pleased that the SEA board and members did not consider my current California connection as a disqualification for president of the Association.

Like H.D. later, Custance appropriates the Dorian aesthetic employed by her precursors and contemporaries Algernon Charles Swinburne, Walter Pater, and Oscar Wilde in order to express homoerotic desire. However, her bisexuality, it is argued, leads her to explore an alternative aesthetic that manifests itself in her use of colour, thus embracing the Ionian aesthetic H.D. rejected and combining it with the Dorian in order to express the fluidity of her own erotic desires.

Carter	Culture, Health & Sexuality	4	3	2002-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 259-279	Taylor & Francis, Ltd.	fla		This study aimed to extend notions of male involvement to maternal health and to understand how Guatemalan men and women think about husband involvement in pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum period. Based on individual interviews and focus groups with men, women, and community health workers in two areas of rural Guatemala, this paper describes the pregnancy-related advice and assistance husbands give, and the reasons men are and are not involved in maternal health. Both men and women reported that male involvement in maternal health is relatively high, desirable, unique and affected by many factors. These include love, men's work demands, economic concerns and men's knowledge. The results help to fill broad gaps in understanding of male involvement in this aspect of family health and to amend stereotypes about husbands' relationship to maternal health and health care. /// Cette étude vise à approfondir les notions d'implication des hommes dans la santé maternelle, et à expliquer de quelle manière les hommes et les femmes guatémaltèques considèrent l'engagement des époux par rapport à la grossesse, l'accouchement et la période post-partum. Basé sur des entretiens individuels et des discussions de groupes menés dans deux zones rurales du Guatemala avec des hommes, des femmes, et des intervenants communautaires de la santé, cet article décrit les conseils et l'assistance relatifs à la grossesse que procurent les maris, et les raisons pour lesquelles les hommes s'impliquent ou non dans la santé maternelle. Aussi bien les hommes que les femmes indiquent que cette implication est relativement élevée, souhaitable, exclusive et influencée par de nombreux facteurs. Ces derniers comprennent l'amour, les exigences professionnelles des hommes, les préoccupations économiques et le niveau de connaissance des hommes. Les résultats contribuent à combler de profondes lacunes dans la compréhension de l'implication des hommes sur cet aspect de la santé de la famille et à modifier les stéréotypes sur le rapport des époux à la santé maternelle et aux soins. /// En este estudio se pretende ampliar las nociónes sobre el involucrarmiente de los hombres en la salud materna y entender qué piensan mujeres y hombres de Guatemala sobre la participación de los maridos en el embarazo, el parto, y el periodo posparto. Basándose en entrevistas individuales y grupos focales con hombres, mujeres y trabajadores de la salud en dos comunidades de zonas rurales de Guatemala, este documento describe la ayuda y consejos dados por los maridos en relación con el embarazo, y el motivo por el que los hombres participan o no en la salud materna. Tanto hombres como mujeres, informaron que la participación de los hombres es bastante alta, deseable, exclusiva y está afectada por muchos factores. Entre ellos el amor, las exigencias laborales de los hombres, sus conocimientos y los problemas económicos. Los resultados de este estudio ayudan a entender mejor la participación masculina en la salud de la familia y a corregir estereotipos sobre relación de los maridos con la salud materna y la atención de la salud.

An alternate third one was derived from the formulations and findings of Byrne and associates. The first hypothesis was that in several samples of interattracted couples, Most Preferred Date, Going Steady, Engaged, Living Together and Married, the attitude test scores of partners would be significantly positive in correlational magnitude. The second hypothesis was that, although the attitude correlations would not differ significantly among the four relationship samples of greater intensity of attraction, the rs for each of these would differ significantly in positive value from that found in the least intensely interattracted, the Most Preferred Date sample. The third hypothesis, an alternate drawn from Byrne and associates formulations and findings, was that correlations would be revealed to have increasingly higher positive values in successively higher levels of interattraction. Not one of the hypotheses was confirmed.

In the last half-century German scholarly readings of Americana have changed profoundly, from a Frankfurt School approach highly critical of mass culture (discussed here with regard to Adorno's essay "The Stars Down to Earth") to diverse interpretations of the popular by contemporary scholars working in American Studies. Sketching the problems and the potential of such recent work, the essay analyzes approaches to popular culture by journalists and non-academic writers: discussions of the reception of the popular, especially with regard to contemporary political contexts in Germany. It also outlines similarly significant research on Americanization conducted by American Studies within the academy. In conclusion the essay calls for studies of American popular culture both abroad and ' at home' and for a combination of academic and non-academic perspectives on the popular.

"Tell me, you know, what is this thing, love?" Cherubino was still a beardless adolescent and did not know the answer, but he took it for granted that there was one. So have most other people, and many of them have tried to give it, but the most noteworthy feature about all their answers is how thoroughly they disagree. Sometimes, it seems, they cannot be referring to the same phenomenon, or even to related ones. After a while one wonders whether there is something wrong with the question itself, or whether perhaps it employs a word of no fixed meaning and can have no answer.¹

T. A. Hoffmann and the experience of Brahms. His Deutsche Volkslieder of 1894, though neither the locus of literary allusions nor autobiography, echoes both the cultural motif and aspects of his experience, including his relationships with Robert and Clara Schumann, and with Agathe von Siebold. The set has been treated to date as a mere compilation, and was not intended for continuous performance, but the emerging overall narrative points towards a characteristically elusive coherence, reinforced through the selection and ordering of melodies and keys. The approach to structure and coherence, the personal overtones, and the evocation of cultural traditions that cross art forms all suggest comparison with the 1893 Brahmsfantasie of Max Klinger. Brahms's own richly allusive words elucidate the importance he attached to the set, not only as a means to demonstrate the power of folksong and give it a place in bourgeois homes, but also as a work of art and a vehicle of personal communication with those to whom he was or had been closest. Many of its features, including perhaps a renewed engagement with Schumann, illuminate characteristic concerns of Brahms's later years.

The images that constitute the principal composition on the vault of the Salone visualize cosmological harmony as defined by the Pythagorean philosophers and the writings of the villa's primary patron, Daniele Barbaro, and his Renaissance contemporaries. A more precise definition of the Empedoclean component of the philosophical foundation of this program can establish that the single most important figure of the decorative ensemble personifies Divine Love. She, and she alone, is capable of unifying the potentially discordant forces in nature and the heavens and can thus allude to the harmony that governs the world in which the Barbaro live in both a microcosmic and a macrocosmic sense.

This article reads Die Wrake van Ragisel as a parody of the traditional themes of worldy chivalry and love. To this end special attention is paid to changes vis-à-vis the original and the consequences these have for our interpretation of the romance. The resulting reading argues for a meaningful role of Die Wrake van Ragisel within the compilation as a whole.

The Finnish experience in World War II is used to bring together various theoretical viewpoints stretching from nationalism research to gender studies and from the history of emotions to psychoanalytically-oriented approaches. The aim is to understand the central and often perverted role of love both in the endurance and motivation for wartime violence. Three interwoven aspects are studied: emotional bonds between soldiers, male-female relations in war, and collective, national bonds of attachment as a source of sacrifice and motivation. Contradictions and fragilities of emotional commitment in war and some of its post-war consequences in Finland are also discussed. Neither the primary group theory not the nationalist ideology as such can explain the soldier's willingness to fight. Many soldiers killed and were killed voluntarily for the sake of what they considered most meaningful and dear in their lives. These bonds of attachment formed the social fabric of the society fabric of the society at war. Positive emotions in war are inseparable from the destructive ones. Love could promote violence and hatred, and occasionally other attachments had to give way to an all-demanding patriotism.

Le désir de Tuptalo pour une communion charnelle et spirituelle avec Dieu est une version ukrainienne orthodoxe du dix-septième siècle de l'exercise spirituelle connue comme devotio moderna -la méditation sur les souffrances de Jésus comme moyen d'édification spirituelle -qui a commencée au début de la Modernité. Ce texte montre la capacité d'un poète ukrainien du dix-septième siècle d'utiliser la sexualité libidinale dans sa vie de prière, et d'unir harmonieusement le monde de la chair avec celui de l'âme. L'article fonctionne à base de deux hypothèses: (1) L'érotisation de Tuptalo du corps de Jésus était consciente -il savait ce qu'il faisait; (2) que sa raison pour le faire était théologique. Les vers de Tuptalo célèbrent l'incarnation du Fils de Dieu, et affirment le rapport personnel et réciproque entre le croyant chrétien et Jésus. L'article conclut que les "Vers sur la Passion de Notre Seigneur" constituent un poème homoerotique de dévotion dans lequel le désir mâle pour un dieu mâle est exprimé sous la forme d'une lyrique d'amour sur le corps nu et violé de Jésus. Ce poème montre que la vie spirituelle de Tuptalo était anthropomorphique et libidinale: son accent sur l'amour et la joie, et son désir erotique pour des relations personnelles et réciproques avec Jésus, le placent dans le continuum d'écrivains et poètes mystiques de l'Europe où sont compris Thérèse d'Avila et John Donne.

Her husband has disappeared, but he had sent her a get, by messenger. This document unfortunately was lost when she fled following the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. Our exploration of the responsum sheds light on a facet of divorce that is not commonly considered today. Divorce is not only a legal procedure for terminating a marriage mired in discontent, but it was also routinely employed to avoid ‘igun or widowhood, evidence that the Jewish legal system is subject to creative compliance.

This paper supports the suggestion. It considers three central emphases in the Augustinian legacy that specify normative differences, normative ranking, and normative links between the commandments. The emphases are: "God-intoxication," "The Predominance of the Double Love Commandment," and "A Good World Gone Wrong." Such consideration explains and defends the claim that a faithful life honors both differences and points of correspondence between God's action and our own. This study indicates that we can go wrong in distinctive ways, and that we should distinguish "relationality" (that obtains both "before God" and "with one another") and "reciprocity" (that obtains "with one another"). The conclusions reached may inform exchanges with other religious traditions, above all "God-intoxicated" ones.

Based on interviews with four generations of Palestinian camp women, the article charts evolving marital patterns and attitudes toward marriage in relation to changing political circumstances and diverse influences. Particular emphasis is given to the third generation and the emergence of individualization of choice and its consequences. The influence of the family and the role of protection in the formation of conjugal bonds are also addressed.

The focal point of this investigation is the 1993 Brian Gibson film, "What's Love Got to Do with It", based on Tina Turner's autobiography. In this essay I "review" "What's Love" in order to consider how the complexities of gender, race, and class construct popular cinematic representations of abusive relationships and how these representations can offer us comfortable positions from which to "see" what we already assume about men as abusers, women as victims, and the racial and class politics of violence.

Within a conceptual framework that focuses on sexuality and social change in a modernising and increasingly open society, and based on data collected from ethnographic fieldwork in Hanoi from 1999 to 2004, this paper describes an emerging sexual culture among urban youth. It highlights the emerging trends, issues, and activities which constitute youth sex culture in present-day urban Vietnam. It further argues that the emerging trends in youth sexual culture are reflective of rapid and diverse changes in Vietnamese society as well as the impacts of market reforms on its moral codes, values, and perceptions. There has been a continuation of the 'traditional' perceptions of gender roles (particularly the expectation of women to uphold propriety and chastity) and, at the same time, a recognition of the increasingly assertive role of young women in 'modern' sexuality and hence of increasing gender equality in this regard. Meanwhile, young Vietnamese nowadays form heterosexual relationships based on both the grammar of love and the grammar of the market.

Uetz	Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology	64	1	2009-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 13-18	Springer	fla		Evolutionary conflicts of interest between the sexes are common, as mating tactics and strategies that increase fitness benefits for one sex may incur costs for the other. As a consequence, antagonistic coevolution between the sexes often results in a complex arms race between male persistence and female resistance. Coercive mating (e.g., forced copulation) likely benefits males by increasing the probability of mating; however, costs to females may be high, including injury or even death. Here, we report on a study of the use of fangs by males of the wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz) during forcible mating with resistant females, which results in hemolymph loss and scar tissue formation in females. Microscopic inspection revealed that fang wounds (evidenced by scar tissue) were absent on unmated (virgin) females but were found on mated females and were significantly more frequent in coercively mated females. Experimental fang immobilization studies found no difference in copulation success between experimental (fangs immobilized) and control (sham manipulation) males. However, males that had use of their fangs had significantly longer copulation duration. These findings represent a previously unknown male mating tactic in spiders and an unrecognized potential cost of mating for female spiders.

The ultimate motives that drive this dialectical tension are love and strife. As dialectical creatures, human are drawn toward each other and seek to distinguish themselves from one another. For a world threatened by its own misunderstanding of ambition and its unreflective acceptance of historical identities, Burke's philosophy of rhetoric offers a way to understand what itmeans to be a dialectical being at a particular point of history, and it does so because it has the practical objective of making the world more just.

"Works of Love" underscores that there is a "neighbor" in "Fear and Trembling" whose justified or damnable banishment occasions Kierkegaard's attempt to "track down" the "illusions" of love. Through de Silentio, Kierkegaard prompts the reader to consider whether the promise has been broken due to radical obedience, lack of faith, dearth of imagination, or a gnarled combination of motives. We are to recognize our kinship with the duplicitous merman and discover that we must, like Tobit's Sarah, receive an extravagant gift. "Fear and Trembling" is thus a text with soteriological import, but with ethical import as well. Convicted by and indebted to God, we are to find in Abraham's act a premonitory paradigm for every engagement.

Using data provided by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, this Article analyzes the tenure trends of federal judges who retired from the bench during 1945-2000. Using time-series regression analysis, this Article shows that, contrary to these claims, tenure trends remained fairly stable over this period for both district and circuit courts. Indeed, the only observable trends were towards longer tenure. The data reveals, however, that recent judicial appointees are wealthier than their predecessors, which may reflect a possible selection effect in members of the bar willing to join the federal bench. Moreover, while judicial salaries have diminished, expenditures within the federal judiciary are growing at a geometric rate, suggesting that judges may enjoy increasing nonsalary benefits.

Aries uses Montaigne's apparent indifference to the deaths of his own infant children as an example to support his case. But it can be argued on the basis of firmer supporting evidence not only that Montaigne was a caring father but also that infant and childhood mortality were not universally high in modern Europe.

Lengnick-Hall, Laura Steele-Clapp	Journal of Organizational Behavior	19	6	1998-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 603-619	Wiley	fla		This paper reports the development of the Career-Family Attitudes Measure (CFAM), a new 56-item instrument for measuring individuals' attitudes towards managing the career and family interface. The measure was administered to a large sample of high school students and factor analyzed to reveal six dimensions of career and family attitudes, which were then scaled. Females in the sample had significantly more positive attitudes towards Balance and Independence than did males, while males had significantly more positive attitudes towards Dominance and Spousal Support than did females. Antecedents such as parental employment history and educational aspirations were significantly related to several of the scales. Results indicated that career-family attitudes involve preferences for the integration of career and family rather than for trade-offs between them. Research to establish the validity and explore the many applications of the CFAM is needed.

A detailed division of "lovestyles" has been proposed by the psychologist John Alan Lee, who suggests that there are six distinct styles of loving. Through a consideration of the application of his typology to the lyrics of popular songs, it can be seen that the categories he has identified have relevance musically, as well as socially and emotionally. When these insights are employed in the analysis of songs written and performed by the Beatles, significant differences are seen in the approach to love between the group's earlier and later material. It is argued that these are not random variations, but indications of the ways in which their personal experiences and professional evolution were reflected in the nature of their music.

Through story, one comes to see an interplay between one's own experiences, one's own desires and one's community — I seek to focus that potential into an embodied pedagogy that highlights power and, as a result, holds all of us accountable for our own situated-ness in systems of power in ways that grant us potential places from which to enact change. Key in this discussion is a careful analytical point of view for seeing the world and a set of practices that work to imagine new ways of talking back.

Dowsett	Culture, Health & Sexuality	10	4	2008-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 329-344	Taylor & Francis, Ltd.	fla		The decade since highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) arrived has been a time of change for gay men in the West. HIV incidence rates have been levelling off--and in some cities, increasing markedly--for the first time since the early years of the pandemic. New sexual subcultures have found expression, including Internet chat rooms, 'poz-only' sex parties, 'barebacking' and crystal methamphetamine use. These circumstances force a re-evaluation of HIV prevention targeting gay communities. We examine the antecedents of current HIV-prevention dilemmas in findings from a qualitative study of gay men who were personally and professionally engaged in HIV/AIDS in Sydney, Australia, in 1997-1998, immediately after the 'protease moment'. The men's lives were characterized by constant and difficult negotiation of gay subjectivities. They did not find a place of uniform belonging in the gay community; rather, ambivalence--toward the gay community and HIV prevention--and fragmentation emerged as themes. Our findings suggest that by the late 1990s, the ethos of safe sex developed in the early HIV/AIDS period was no longer a unifying cultural value. We explore the conditions that led to this shift and the implications for HIV prevention in the 21st century. /// La décennie qui s'est écoulée depuis l'arrivée des thérapies antirétrovirales puissantes représente une ère de changements pour les hommes gay dans les pays occidentaux. L'incidence du VIH s'est stabilisée à un niveau élevé -- et dans certaines villes, elle augmente nettement -- pour la première fois depuis les premières années de la pandémie de sida. De nouvelles sous cultures ont trouvé des espaces d'expression, dont les forums de discussion sur Internet, les partouzes " réservées aux séropos ", le " barebacking " et l'usage du " Cristal ". Ces circonstances obligent à une réévaluation de la prévention du VIH en direction des communautés gay. Nous examinons les antécédents des dilemmes actuels dans la prévention à partir d'une étude qualitative qui a porté sur des hommes gay, engagés aux plans personnels et professionnels dans la lutte contre le sida à Sydney, en 1997-98, immédiatement après " l'avènement des antiprotéases ". La vie de ces hommes était caractérisée par une négociation constante et difficile des subjectivités gay. Ils ne trouvaient pas d'espace d'appartenance uniforme dans la communauté gay, mais plutôt de l'ambivalence -- envers la communauté gay et la prévention du VIH -- et une fragmentation qui émergeaient en tant que thèmes. Nos résultats suggèrent que vers la fin des années 90, l'ethos du sexe sans risque développé au cours de la première période de l'épidémie de sida, n'était plus une valeur culturelle unificatrice. Nous explorons les facteurs qui ont amené ce changement et leurs implications pour la prévention du VIH au 21ème siècle. /// La década desde que se introdujo el tratamiento antirretroviral de alta eficacia ha demostrado ser un momento de cambio para los hombres homosexuales en occidente. Las tasas de incidencia del VIH se han equilibrado y en algunas ciudades han aumentado marcadamente, por primera vez desde los primeros años de la pandemia. Las nuevas subculturas sexuales han encontrado cómo expresarse, por ejemplo a través de las salas chat en Internet, las fiestas sexuales 'sólo para seropostivos', 'penetración anal sin preservativo' y uso de cristal de metanfetamina. Estas circunstancias nos obligan a reevaluar la prevención del VIH entre las comunidades homosexuales. Aquí analizamos los antecedentes de los actuales dilemas de la prevención del virus del sida en los resultados de un estudio cualitativo de hombres homosexuales que tuvieron una relación personal y profesional con el VIH/sida en Sydney, Australia, en 1997-98, inmediatamente después del 'momento de la proteasa'. Las vidas de los hombres estaban caracterizadas por una negociación constante y difícil de las subjetividades homosexuales. No hallaban un lugar de pertenencia constante en la comunidad homosexual, sino que más bien surgieron los temas de la ambivalencia hacia la comunidad homosexual y la prevención del VIH, y la fragmentación. Nuestros resultados indican que a finales de los noventa, la ética del sexo seguro desarrollada a principios del periodo del VIH/sida dejó de ser un valor cultural unificado. Aquí analizamos las condiciones que desencadenaron este cambio y las implicaciones que esto tiene para la prevención del VIH en el siglo XXI.

For many figures in the crowded panel the artist relied on prototypes provided by the cycles of illustrations to Ovid's "Metamorphoses." However, the general theme of the painting as well as the central motif of Cupid's triumphal chariot do not originate in Ovid's writings but have their source in Petrarch's "Trionfi." An examination of the traditional iconography of the Petrarchan 'Triumph of Love' highlights Francken's originality. He replaced Petrarch's endless procession of desolate lovers by a plethora of narrative scenes of tragic love affairs as told by Ovid. Francken revitalized Petrarch's didactic allegorical lineup of exempla by calling on the narrative verve of Ovid and his illustrators.

Y., site are presented. The leachate was determined to contain over 80 chemical compounds, including 27 measurable priority pollutants. To contain the leachate, a perimeter tile drainage system has been installed and evaluated. To treat the leachate, a system composed of a clarifier, multimedia filters, and a two-stage carbon adsorption system has been installed and evaluated. This system has been operating since November 1978 treating 15 to 265  ${\rm m}^{3}$ /d (4000 to 70 000 gal/day) of leachate. The influent total organic carbon has ranged from 120 to 1 960 mg/l. The system has operated consistently to meet the discharge standards. It has been demonstrated that the system can reduce most priority pollutants below Environmental Protection Agency recognized detection limits.

We model tough love by modifying the Barro-Becker standard altruism model in two ways. First, the child's discount factor is endogenously determined, so lower childhood consumption leads to a higher discount factor later in life. Second, the parent evaluates the child's lifetime utility with a constant high discount factor. Our model predicts that parental transfers will fall when the child's discount factor falls. This is in contrast with the standard altruism model, which predicts that parental transfers are independent of exogenous changes in the child's discount factor.

For instance, they regularly surrounded John Donne's popular Ovidian, or otherwise anti-Petrarchan, elegies with libels of the early Stuart period. Joshua Eckhardt focuses here on miscellanies that include such anti-courtly love poems, by both Donne and Francis Beaumont, among libels on the Overbury afiair in order to demonstrate how libels transformed the religious and political associations of anti-courtly love poetry.

At the turn of the last century, courts grappled with speculation in two important areas of contract litigation--commodities futures trading and the assignment of life insurance policies--just as courts today must confront their modern analogues in two fast-growing industries: trading in derivatives and viatical settlements. This Essay focuses on a transformative moment in the development of contract law when the question of gambling was eventually swallowed and internalized, as if the problem were solved. However, no analytic formula could distinguish gambling from risk allocation. Instead, the gambling question was subjected to a complex and indecisive cultural negotiation and displacement. A close reading of judicial rhetoric reveals the role of legal discourse in the process of coming to terms with the fears and uncertainties that accompanied the transition into modernity. More than straightforward prohibitions on certain types of conduct, the judicial grappling with risk and uncertainty offered its audiences an image with which to identify: by recognizing that an element of gambling existed in all economic activity, contract discourse made way for the emergence of an individual who could claim mastery even while acknowledging uncertainty.

In this paper, I discuss the effects the slave trade had on the people who were "left behind"—those Africans who did not embark on slave ships but who nonetheless experienced the constant interruption of the slave trade in their personal lives, even long after the transatlantic trade ended. This paper discusses, in particular, the effect the slave trade had on African intimate and family relations through a reading of some of Samuel Crowther's papers and of Ama Ata Aidoo's dramatic depiction entitled Anozva. In a letter he wrote from school in Sierra Leone, Samuel Crowther describes the loss of his family in a slave raid in 1821, and then in a later diary, he recounts the somewhat hesitant, bitter-sweet reunion with his family in the 1846. In Anowa, Aidoo depicts a slaveholder in the 1870s who, because of his relationship to slaves and the slave trade, is literally made impotent; though he reaches out to his slaves as if they were his family, he is not able to have a family life himself. Both the fictional and the nonfictional texts depict the endemic failure of intimacy that was engendered by the slave trade in Africa, revealing the way in which the economy of the slave trade was calculated in such a way that family bonds and human relationships were diminished in value.

Williams	The Journal of Religious Ethics	18	2	1990-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 15-31	Wiley	fla		In the social thought of Martin Luther King, Jr., the ideal society is to be sought through the establishment of justice understood as an embodiment of love. King, using the model of the love-justice relationship developed by Paul Tillich, understood this relation to be organic and universal, finding it not only in Judaeo-Christian tradition (particularly as interpreted through the African American religious experience) but also in other religions of the world (particularly Hinduism as interpreted by Gandhi). This essay explores the love-justice relationship in King's thought in terms of its sources, its implication for his understanding of the state, and the implications of love for a full conception of justice in the ideal society-"the beloved community."

S. Anderson (1966). Still, a truly convincing alternative to the accepted view has never been proposed. A reading of the ode in the context of the "First Book of Odes", however, shows that "Odes" 1.14 is part of a series of poems ("Odes" 1.5, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17) that feature different kinds of love triangles. These poems provide multiple clues that the ship in 1.14 is not a worn-out prostitute, as has been argued, but an attractive young hetaera faced with the choice between a younger, passionate lover and a calmer, more mature admirer.

Yet a majority of girls marry by the time they are 16 and boys by 18, and with marriage they become sexually active. CHETNA, an NGO in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, started to run sex education workshops in 1990 as a part of residential health camps for adolescents. In an interactive manner using role plays, games, reading materials and small group discussions, we talk about physical as well as emotional changes in adolescence, love, sex and sexuality, and gender issues. We have seen positive changes in many young people but also found that parental involvement is essential to sustain the gains made and to provide support. /// En Inde, les adolescents n'ont pratiquement aucune source d'éducation sexuelle, que ce soit chez eux, auprès de membres de leur famille ou à l'école. Pourtant, beaucoup de filles sont mariées avant 16 ans, beaucoup de garçons avant 18 ans, et leur activité sexuelle commence avec le mariage. CHETNA, une ONG d'Ahmedabad (Gujarat) a entrepris en 1990 des ateliers d'éducation sexuelle dans le cadre de camps pour adolescents. De manière interactive, en nous servant de jeux, de jeux de rôle, de lectures, de discussions en petits groupes, nous y évoquons les transformations physiques et émotionnelles de l'adolescence, l'amour, la sexualité et les relations sexuelles, et les problêmes en matière de genre. Nous avons enregistré chez nombre de jeunes une évolution positive, mais nous avons aussi constaté que la participation des parents est indispensable pour maintenir les acquis et apporter un soutien. /// En la India, los adolescentes prácticamente no reciben educación sexual alguna de parte de fuentes tradicionales como el hogar, la familia, o la escuela. Sin embargo, la mayoría de las jóvenes se casan a los 16 años y los jóvenes a los 18; sólo entonces, tras el matrimonio, se vuelven sexualmente activos. CHETNA, una ONG en Ahmedabad, Gujarat, comenzó a ofrecer seminarios sobre educación sexual en 1990, como parte del programa de sus campamentos de salud para adolescentes. De forma interactiva, haciendo uso de representaciones, juegos, materiales de lectura y pequeños grupos de discusión, podemos hablar sobre los cambios físicos y emocionales en la adolescencia, el amor, el sexo y la sexualidad, y temas relacionados con el género. Hemos observado cambios positivos en muchos jóvenes, pero también hemos advertido que la participación de los padres es esencial para mantener los logros alcanzados y dar el apoyo necesario.

Both questionnaire and intensive interview data were collected from a sample of individuals with long-term marriages. Symbolic interactionist theory and frame analysis are used to describe the nature and processes of marriage and to order and interpret the data. Findings indicate that religious ideas influence the occurrence of interaction patterns that manifest benevolent love. Marital quality is associated with this interaction.

This article explores habits regarding sex, marriage, and births behind these demographic features. It draws on an interview with an elderly woman who tells her own experiences and what she observed during most of her life time. The focus is on the woman's subjectivity and how she interprets the relative sexual freedom that women in this area seem to have been granted. Her testimony often differs from interpretations offered in ethnographic research. Both the optimistic view praising sexual freedom as well as the contrasting view that deplores women's victimization seem inadequate to grasp the woman's testimony. According to her recollections intrusion into a married relationship often occurred, the father of children of pre-marital births was not necessarily the man who later became the husband of the mother, and child abuse by the mother's new husband sometimes occurred. It also occurred that a woman abandoned her previous man to go with a new man. Love seems to have been a matter of great concern to both men and women in this region. The cost of sexual behaviours existed but it was not very high, partially because of economic independence of women, partially because of social support networks for taking care of the children born. Les villages de la côte sud-ouest du Japon sont historiquement connus pour leurs traits démographiques particuliers. Ces traits comprennent de fréquentes naissances prémaritales et hors mariages ainsi que de fréquents déplacements d'enfants entre les familles. Cet article examine les habitudes sexuelles, maritales et natales qui se cachent derrière ces données démographiques. L'article est basé sur l'interview d'une femme centenaire qui raconte ses propres expériences et observations. L'accent est mis sur la subjectivité de la femme et sur sa façon d'interpréter la relative liberté sexuelle accordée aux femmes de cette région. Son témoignage diffère souvent des interprétations ethnographiques. Aussi bien les regards optimistes louant la liberté sexuelle que les regards déplorant la victimisation des femmes sont inadéquats pour saisir le témoignage de la femme. Selon ses souvenirs, les relations maritales furent souvent sujettes à intrusion, le père des enfants nés avant mariage ne fut pas nécessairement l'homme qui devint le mari de la mère, et il arrivait que les enfants fussent maltraités par le nouveau mari de la mère. Il arrivait aussi qu'une femme quittait son mari pour aller vivre avec un autre homme. L'amour semble avoir été un sujet de grande préoccupation aussi bien pour les femmes que pour les hommes dans cette région. Le prix des comportements sexuels n'était pas très élevé, en particulier à cause de l'indépendance économique des femmes et à cause de supports sociaux qui prenaient soin des enfants nés hors mariage. Las ciudades costeras del sudoeste de Japón se caracterizan por unos comportamientos demográficos peculiares que incluyen nacimientos pre-matrimoniales y fuera del matrimonio así como frecuentes movimientos residenciales de los hijos entre los diferentes hogares. Este artículo examina las costumbres sexuales, matrimoniales y reproductivas que se esconden detrás de estas características. El análisis se concentra en la entrevista con una mujer anciana que relata las experiencias y apreciaciones desarrolladas a lo largo de su vida, siendo su subjetividad e interpretaciones respecto a la libertad sexual que las mujeres de esta zona parecen haber gozado el centro del análisis. Su testimonio difiere, en muchas ocasiones, de la perspectiva ofrecida por la investigación etnográfica. Tanto la visión optimista que ensalza la primacía de la libertad sexual así como la perspectiva contraria que rechaza la existencia de discriminación contra la mujer parecen inadecuadas para contener la totalidad del discurso de esta mujer. Sus recuerdos dan cuenta de intrusiones en las relaciones matrimoniales así como de casos de maltrato de niños por parte de los nuevos esposos de las mujeres, en función de que el padre prematrimonial de los menores no siempre acababa convirtiéndose en marido de la madre. Su discurso también señala situaciones en que las mujeres abandonaban a sus parejas para formar nuevas relaciones sentimentales. El amor, por tanto, parece haberse constituido en una cuestión de gran importancia para los hombres y mujeres de esta región. Los costes sociales de los diferentes comportamientos sexuales no eran excesivamente gravosos para las mujeres debido a su independencia económica y a la existencia de redes sociales de apoyo para el cuidado de los niños nacidos fuera del matrimonio.

Syvertsen, Angela M. Robertson, Lawrence A. Palinkas, M. Gudelia Rangel, Gustavo Martinez, Steffanie A. Strathdee	Culture, Health & Sexuality	15	5/6	2013-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 540-554	Taylor & Francis, Ltd.	fla		This study explores the affective dimensions of female sex workers' relationships with their intimate, non-commercial partners and assesses how emotions shape each partner's sexual and drug-related risk within their relationship. We draw on qualitative data from a study of HIV, sexually transmitted infections and high-risk behaviours among female sex workers and their non-commercial partners in Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, to illustrate that these couples share relationships based on love, trust, respect and emotional and material support. These relationships range in emotional intensity, which shapes partners' decisions not to use condoms with each other. Drugs were important in most couples' relationships. Among injectors, syringe sharing was common and represented both a sign of care and a pragmatic reaction to conditions of material scarcity. Our findings suggest that couple-based HIV interventions to address dual sexual and drug-related risks should be tailored to the emotional dynamics of sex workers' intimate relationships. Cette étude explore les dimensions affectives des relations entre les travailleuses du sexe et leurs partenaires intimes (en dehors de leur clientèle) et évalue comment les sentiments déterminent les risques sexuels et liés à l'usage de drogues dans le cadre de ces relations. Nous exploitons les données qualitatives d'une étude sur le VIH, les maladies sexuellement transmissibles et les comportements à risque de niveau élevé parmi les travailleuses du sexe et leurs partenaires intimes à Tijuana et à Ciudad Juárez (Mexique) pour montrer que ces couples sont fondés sur l'amour, la confiance, le respect et le soutien émotionnel et matériel. Selon les données, la décision des partenaires de ne pas utiliser de préservatifs était déterminée par le degré d'intensité émotionnelle qui existait entre eux. La consommation de drogues avait une place importante dans la vie de la plupart des couples. Chez les injecteurs, le partage de seringues était fréquent et représentait à la fois un signe d'affection et une réaction pragmatique à la précarité matérielle. Nos résultats suggèrent que les interventions sur le VIH ciblant les couples et visant à traiter des risques à la fois sexuels et liés à l'usage de drogues doivent prendre en compte la dynamique émotionnelle des relations intimes chez les travailleuses du sexe. El presente estudio analiza las dimensiones afectivas de las relaciones entre las sexoservidoras y sus parejas íntimas no comerciales, evaluando cómo las emociones determinan tanto el riesgo sexual como el riesgo vinculado al uso de drogas por parte de las dos personas en la relación. Los autores se apoyan en la información cualitativa arrojada por un estudio sobre el VIH, las infecciones transmitidas sexualmente y los comportamientos de alto riesgo que se establecen entre sexoservidoras y sus parejas no comerciales en Tijuana y en Ciudad Juárez, México, con el fin de demostrar que estas parejas mantienen relaciones basadas en el amor, la confianza, el respeto, el apoyo emocional y material. Dichas relaciones varían en cuanto a su intensidad emocional, lo cual influye en la decisión de no usar condones durante sus relaciones íntimas. Asimismo, las drogas representan un aspecto importante en las relaciones de la mayoría de estas parejas. Entre las personas que se inyectan, se constató que es común compartir jeringas, lo cual se vivencia como una señal de afecto y como una respuesta pragmática ante las condiciones de escasez material. Las conclusiones señalan que las intervenciones que pretendan enfrentar tanto los riesgos de sexo dual como aquellos vinculados al uso de drogas por parejas con VIH, deberán tomar en cuenta las dinámicas emocionales que forman parte de las relaciones íntimas de las sexoservidoras.

Her painful journey recognizes the moral ambivalence of a victim who has to learn to forgive herself for a past for which she holds herself responsible. With its frequent temporal shifts, highly subjective point of view, and self-conscious narration, the film employs a “modernist” representational style that intends to represent the trauma of the past and its post-traumatic resonance in the present. Such a visual landscape, however, also challenges the audience's ability (and willingness) to engage with a character whose testimony already threatens their sense of moral order and human compassion. In this article, I examine the aesthetic and ethical challenges of rendering personal pain accessible to an audience often far removed from the experience of the victim.

Much as classical antiquity informed the conception of sentimental Bildung, sentimental Bildung and its cultivation of particular attachments also informed classical scholarship's model of itself. With research thus conceptualized as a quasi-personal relationship with antiquity, scholarship could draw on a contemporary language of emotionality.

Nel sesto episodio della sua pluripremiata serie Decalogo, il regista polacco Krzysztof Kielowski narra di una storia d'amore fuori del comune, al cui interno elabora una complessa metafora dell'evento-Cristo. Il film, coi titoli Decalogo sei oppure Breve film sull'amore (Non desiderare la donna d'altri), è notevole ed è di particolare interesse per la ricerca perché esiste in tre versioni: la sceneggiatura pubblicata, la versione filmica breve di cinquantatre minuti e la versione (originale) lunga di ottantacinque. Il saggio è perciò suddiviso in due parti. Nella prima pubblicata in questo numero di Gregorianum, inizialmente si analizzano la narrazione di base del film e l'orientamento generale della sua tematica cristica. In seguito, ci si dedica ad una considerazione più dettagliata della versione originale e lunga del film, Un breve film sull'amore, che rappresenta la più completa delle rappresentazioni cristologiche. Nel prossimo numero di Gregorianum, la seconda parte del saggio analizza per contro le altre due versioni del film, Decalogo sei e la sceneggiatura, indicando come le differenze tra questi due testi e la versione originale del film creino sia sottili che drammatiche divergenze nelle loro rappresentazioni cristologiche. Infine, sono presi in esame il prologo e l'epilogo della versione originale, notando in dettaglio quanto essi conferiscano a questa versione del film un significato teologico più complesso e profondo delle altre due versioni.

In the 1790s, however, it went into rapid decline. One reason is that when Europeans tried to establish families and polities in line with the dictates of sentimentalism, these efforts often ended in failure. A noteworthy example is provided by the career of Benoît Leborgne, later known as Bennett de Boigne, who rose to fame as a soldier of fortune in India, founding a kind of anti-empire in collaboration with Mahadaji Sindhia between 1784 and 1795. The collapse of his state building efforts— and of his marriages—clearly demonstrate the pitfalls of "following one's heart" in the eighteenth-century manner.

Rather, he sought to preserve a place for virtue in the private sphere of honor and character, where they would help prevent the excesses of libertinism. This article explores Hume's understanding of how pride and the desire for fame help elevate the character of liberal commercial society and then explores his responses to the problems that arise because pride and love of fame are not fully compatible with the egalitarian and humanitarian ethos of liberal constitutionalism.

I will read the blowing of the wind presented by "Andenken" as a conversation between lovers—indeed as the intersection of two conversations, one between Friedrich Hölderlin and Susette Gontard, and one between the poet and the reader. Drawing on my unconventional rendition of Hegel's theory of recognition, I develop a theory of reading that calls on the reader to contribute to the poem's efforts to facilitate a love that is mutual. In a further multiplication of crossed couples, the human lovers are interlaced with the poem's several pairs of trees until finally a Gespräch not so much in, but among words, emerges.

A few theoretical studies suggest that males may exhibit—but only under rare circumstances—a reversed male mate choice (RMMC; i.e., highly competitive males focus on the most fecund females, while the low‐quality males exclusively pair with less fecund mates to avoid being outcompeted by stronger rivals). Here we propose a new model to explore RMMC by relaxing some of the restrictive assumptions of the previous models and by considering an extended range of factors known to alter the strength of sexual selection (males’ investment in reproduction, difference of quality between females, operational sex ratio). Unexpectedly, we found that males exhibited a reversed mate choice under a wide range of circumstances. RMMC mostly occurs when the female encounter rate is high and males devote much of their time to breeding. This condition‐dependent strategy occurs even if there is no risk of injury during the male‐male contest or when the difference in quality between females is small. RMMC should thus be a widespread yet underestimated component of sexual selection and should largely contribute to the assortative pairing patterns observed in numerous taxa.

The author addresses fundamental differences between schools and cultural organizations, particularly in terms of educational priorities and professional development of educators. Also, different ways in which institutions in the United States, Canada, and England attempt to enrich public awareness and understanding of the arts and sciences are examined. Museum settings and performing arts organizations in the Province of Ontario are a specific focus. Policy and document analysis, interviews with staff, and observations and conversations with museum visitors provide insights into educational intentions of organizations and educational experiencing for visitors. The author advocates certain changes in attitudes for professionals working in education and invites art educators and teachers to explore innovative ways in which schools, museums, and performing arts organizations can collaborate in educating the public.

Néanmoins les formules révèlent beaucoup sur le développement politique de la papauté et de sa conscience de soi à cette époque. Peu après 731 les relations des élections pontificales deviennent un élément essentiel des biographies des Papes et au cours du huitième siècle les auteurs développent les formules, qui seront toutes standartisées au neuvième siècle. Les relations en question ont contribué à légitimer le pouvoir temporel des papes, qui se débarassaient du contrôle politique de Byzance et façonnaient un État indipendent, l'État Pontifical. The method by which popes actually were chosen in the Early Middle Ages remains obscure, because the major primary source, the Liber Pontificalis, describes these elections in formulaic language. However, the formulae themselves reveal much about papal self-understanding and political development. Not long after 731, election accounts appear in the Liber, and throughout the eighth century authors worked out the formulae that became standardized by the ninth century. Election accounts legitimatized a papacy that was freeing itself from Byzantine overlordship and organizing an independent state, the Papal State.

The theory is poorly conceptualized and its implications are misunderstood. The author defines the terms and clarifies the relationship. He then examines 24 cultures and finds a strong correlation between the variables. Historical analysis also supports the theory. Evidence is presented that romantic love in the U.S. is declining as permissiveness increases. The implications of the theory for marriage are discussed.

It is argued that, at the time when the Stern-Jernstedt Rule took effect, in early Demotic, there were two constructions wḫȝ n 'seek' and wḫȝ 'wish' and that the verb wḫȝ in the latter meaning was barred from the indirect connection of the direct object because wḫȝ n meant 'seek' in all its conjugations.

Mendham	The Journal of Religious Ethics	35	4	2007-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 591-625	Wiley	fla		This essay explores connections and divergences between Alasdair MacIntyre's eudaimonistic ethic and Søren Kierkegaard's agapeistic ethic--perhaps the greatest proponents of these ethical paradigms from the past two centuries. The purpose of the work is threefold. First, to demonstrate an impressive amount of convergence and complementarity in their approaches to the transcendent grounds of an ethic of flourishing, the rigors necessary for a proper self-love, and the other-directed nature of proper social relations. Second, given the inapplicability of common dichotomies, to pinpoint more precisely where Kierkegaard departs from eudaimonism, and where MacIntyre departs from agapeism. Finally, to show that both Kierkegaard's and MacIntyre's grounds for departure are inadequate, and thus that the most central insights of eudaimonist and agapeist ethics can be harmonized to a greater extent than either Kierkegaard's or MacIntyre's framework can allow.

Beech	The Sixteenth Century Journal	34	3	2003-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 635-652	The Sixteenth Century Journal	fla		Two anonymous and little known works of art from sixteenth-century France, a poem of 1545, "Les Obsèques d'Amour," and a somewhat later painting now in the Louvre, Les Funérailles de l'amour, have in common their portrayal of the funeral of Cupid, the god of love, a theme otherwise unknown at the time and one which has resisted modern attempts to explain its meaning. This article proposes that in both cases Cupid's burial is a metaphor for the rejection of carnal love by a group of Parisian women then charged with sexual immorality and that the painting is derived from the poem. The accusation and the assertion of innocence formed part of a controversy that extended back to 1529 and involved both prominent Parisian poets and wives of officials at the court of François I. Thus, far from being exercises in mythological fantasy, the poem and the painting reflect mundane conflict in contemporary Parisian society and are potentially important sources for the literary world and feminist debate.

The current research explored parent-child love attitude similarity in 86 triads composed of young adult children and their parents. Measures assessed demographics, love attitudes, parent-child relationship quality, children's self-disclosure, and parental relationship satisfaction. Results indicated considerable love attitude similarity between marital partners (parents), but little similarity between parents and children.

Evidence of Beckett's own cynical attitude supports several of the overt themes of the work: vanitas, or the irrelevance of human actions, the outsider or misanthrope, scatology or obscenity, and the demystification of love and other high values. Further analysis of intertextual relationships (e.g., Dante) and genre affinities all leads to the conclusion that the characters, their behaviour, their motives, and their emotions are a direct heir to the cynics' worldview. Moreover, "First Love" aims to express and pass on the cynical philosophy through the comic mode.

Theoretically, the Nuuraa can be viewed as an ongoing process of mediation between cultural symbols. A Nuuraa performer inhabits an ambiguous and power-filled socio-ritualistic universe associated with unbridled magical know-how.

Rooted in the discipline of animal studies, the article argues that due to the celebratory destabilizing of order for the majority of the play, John Fletcher and Philip Massinger's The Sea Voyage, first performed by the King's Men in 1622, is not so much a piece that endorses traditional hierarchies and the ‘dignity of man’ as it is a farcical romp aimed at reducing all humans to a more animal level.

This study demonstrates the inadequacy of this claim and argues that as an imitation of Honglou meng, Flowers of Shanghai employs irony and parody in its treatment of the motifs of dream, romantic love, and family affairs. It also mocks the idealization of the courtesan and her literati patrons in earlier courtesan novels. Han Bangqing's reworking of courtesan literature is interpreted as a somber selfmirroring vis-à-vis the urbanized and commercialized Shanghai at the end of the nineteenth century.

On the one hand, hostesses reject the popular media's emphasis on romantic love and sexual purity as a thin disguise for the ugly reality of men's sexual exploitation of women, and they actively perform and commodify romance for their instrumental purposes. On the other hand, hostesses resort to supernatural forces to determine their romantic fate and to seek out ideal love.

Latvia is a heterocracy where the supremacy of heterosexual people is symbolically embodied in the constitution. It is an explicitly homophobic environment where members of the LGBT community, if they are open about their sexual orientation, can encounter physical violence. Sweden, on the other hand, is praised for being sexually progressive, and the marriage laws are, in contrast to Latvia, gender neutral. However, I argue that both societies are ruled by heteronormativity, requiring that LGBT persons adapt their lifestyles to the main tenets of the heterosexual normative model of cohabitation, and that the difference between the two is only in the degree of the adaptations required.

Situated in the rich cultural environment of Cinquecento, Italy, Tullia d'Aragona's Dialogo della Infinità d'Amore offers not only a unique contribution to Renaissance theories of love, but also forces a reexamination of the aims and methods of communication, and provokes a reflection on philosophy's very own (male) self-conception.

Reinforcement theory (Miller and Siegel, 1972) is used to formulate hypotheses of four kinds of effects of love and liking: (1) Effects on stage of relationship and break-up of it. (2) Subjective effects, i.e., effects of loving and liking one's dating partner in terms of happiness, tension, and communicative agreement. (3) Synergic effects, i.e., effects of being loved and being liked in terms of the same variables. (4) Mutuality, the degree to which loving and liking and other feelings are reciprocated between partners. Love was found related to dating stage for both sexes but not related to break-up for either sex. Liking was found to be related to both dating stage and break-up for males but not for females. Neither subjective nor synergic effects were found for love, but both effects were found for liking. Mutuality was found for happiness and tension but not for love or liking. It was concluded that love is not dependent on reinforcement principles but that liking is. Futher discussion on detailed aspects is offered.

Through a process of collaboration, active learning, and audience development, professional and personal trust developed among eleven museums. Previously identified barriers were overcome and expectations of the original project were surpassed leading to a shared joint-platform, visible collaboration, and an international profile. The case study provides a model for museum collaboration and trust-building among different organisations.

The narrator-protagonist Albertine Johnson, who is in Marcel's position, does not adopt the latter's egocentric and pleasure-oriented metaphysics but prefers to pass on the narrator-voice to the members of her tribal family. Thus Albertine draws the attention away from the self to the other as an individual part of the plural family body.—Erdrich's and Wedekind's Lulus appear as similar in their (metaphorical) origin, biography, and man-eating. Lulu Lamartine, however, incarnates life-giving rather than death-bringing nature and therefore represents the motherly female rather than the femme fatale type, who in Wedekind exclusively brings death to her lovers while hastening toward her tragic end.

Since its rediscovery in the late 1960s it has been of great interest to both film historians and students of Appalachia. Through the use of personal papers, memoirs and other local history resources, this paper clarifies many of the myths surrounding its production and reception.

Based on work by Sorokin, an eight-item scale was developed and validated to assess what he termed "religious love:" the feeling of loving and being loved by God. Using a sample of 205 family practice outpatients, hierarchical OLS regression was used to investigate the effect of this construct on a standard self-rating of health. Several sets of factors were hypothesized to mediate the relationship between religious love and self-rated health: religious involvement, social resources, psychological resources, objective health status, and sociodemographic factors. These effects were controlled for in six successive models. In the end, despite controlling for effects of 15 variables and scales that accounted for nearly 40% of the variance in self-rated health, the statistically significant association between religious love and self-rated health at baseline (β = .33, p < .001) remained strong, significant, and only marginally affected (β = .24, p < .05). These findings provide evidence that loving and being loved by God exerts a positive influence on perceptions of health.

This paper examines the references to these verses, both explicit and via phrases alluding to the ordinance. Two specific aspects of the law are alluded to in Jubilees: "You shall not hate your kinsfolk in your heart" (Lev 19:17a) and "Love your fellow as yourself" (Lev 19:18b). The author of Jubilees understands the first as relating to peaceful coexistence, the second to malicious intent, specifically the intent to murder. This exegesis is consistent throughout Jubilees, as attested by the usage of fixed terms and idioms depicting the observance/violation of the law across various literary units.

Zelizer	Viviana Zelizer's recent book, The Purchase of Intimacy (2005), presents an innovative theory of how social and lega actors negotiate nghts and obligations when money changes hands in intimate relationships—a perspective that could change how we understand many things, from valuations of homemaking labor to the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. This essay describes Zelizer's critique of the reductionist "Hostile Worlds" and "Nothing But" approaches to economic exchange in intimate relationships and then explains her more three-dimensional approach, "Connected Lives." While Zelizer focuses on family law, the essay goes beyond that context, extending Zelizer's approach to transfers of genetic material and concluding that her approach could point toward a more equitable resolution of disputes in and about these markets.

Parker, Stefano Allesina	Oikos	121	7	2012-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1005-1008	Nordic Society Oikos, Wiley	fla		The most highly cited ecologists and environmental scientists provide both a benchmark and unique opportunity to consider the importance of research funding. Here, we use citation data and self-reported funding levels to assess the relative importance of various factors in shaping productivity and potential impact. The elite were senior Americans, well funded, with large labs. In contrast to Canadian NSERC grant holders (not in the top 1%), citations per paper did not increase with higher levels of funding within the ecological elite. We propose that this is good news for several reasons. It suggests that the publications generated by the top ecologists and environmental scientists are subject to limitations, that higher volume of publications is always important, and that increased funding to ecologists in general can shift our discipline to wider research networks. As expected, collaboration was identified as an important factor for the elite, and hopefully, this serves as a positive incentive to funding agencies since it increases the visibility of their research.

Pallotta	Sociological Perspectives	43	4	2000-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 549-580	University of California Press	fla		We focus on the changing understanding of romance in contemporary American society. Through an analysis of romantic comedies and dramas produced in Hollywood between 1930 and the present, we demonstrate how the decline of the romantic drama is due to significant social and cultural change, the most important of which is the weakening of norms governing the choice of romantic partners. The romantic comedy, however, has more than compensated for the decline in dramas, with the decade of the 1990s seeing more romantic films produced than in any previous time in the history of filmmaking. Although the contemporary romantic comedy almost invariably reinforces the most conservative tendencies in our culture, we argue that these films nonetheless work effectively to reinforce a usable cultural script governing romantic behavior. By depicting ideal culture as a real possibility, the romantic comedy nurtures the utopian wish of "slipping one over on modernity." /// [Spanish] En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el cambio del entendimiento del romance en la sociedad contemporánea Norteamericana. A través de un análisis de comedias románticas y dramas producidos en Hollywood entre 1930 y el presente, demostramos cómo la disminución del drama romántico se ha debido a cambios significativos sociales y culturales, entre los cuales, el más importante es el debilitamiento de normas que gobiernan la selección de compañeros románticos. La comedia romántica, durante la década de los noventa en que se han producido más películas románticas que en ningún otro momento en la historia de la filmación, ha compensado por la disminución en dramas. Aunque la comedia contemporánea romántica, invariablemente refuerza las tendencias mas conservadoras en nuestra cultura, argumentamos que estas películas trabajan efectivamente para reforzar un guión cultural efectivo que gobierne el comportamiento romántico. Con la descripción de una cultura ideal como una posibilidad real, la comedia romántica alimenta el deseo utópico de "pasar por desapercibida la modernidad." /// [Chinese] (Unicode for Chinese abstract). /// [Japanese] (Unicode for Japanese abstract).

As the frontispiece of the second English edition of Charles-Alphonse Dufresnoy's The Art of Painting (1716, republished 1750, 1769), it would have been very well known to English artists. There are good reasons for thinking that this example depends on that by François Chauveau, after Charles Le Brun, which was created specifically to accompany Charles Perrault's poetic version of La peinture (Paris, 1668). Perrault perhaps originated, from a hint in Junius, the detail of Love guiding the Corinthian Maid's drawing.

Each of the three lonely individuals, seated in an elevated, winged armchair, chants an extended rhapsody about his or her past life, a rhapsody that celebrates the travel, the wine and music, and the joy and love shared with an attentive companion. Selected passages from Richard Wagner's music dramas-Tannhauser, The Valkyrie, and Tristan and Isolde-provide the necessary melodic counterparts for these rhapsodies because Friel, like Wagner before him, is experimenting in this play with the reciprocal relationship between dramatic action and tonal harmonies. /// Les amours de Cass McGuire de Brian Friel est un drame musical wagnérien qui décrit les actes désespérés et evasifs de trois personnes (Trilbe, Ingram et Cass) qui, confinées dans un asile de vieillards faussement nommé La maison d'Eden, réarrangent et falsifient leurs passés décevants. Chacun de ces personnages solitaires, assis dans un fauteuil ailé surélevé, chante une rhapsodie prolongée sur sa vie et son passé, une rhapsodie qui célèbre les voyages, le vin et la musique et la joie et l'amour partagés avec un compagnon prévenant. Des passages choisis des drames musicaux de Richard Wagner comme Tanhauser, La Walkyrie et Tristan et Iseut, offrent les contreparties mélodiques nécessaires ces rhapsodies parce que Friel, tout comme Wagner avant lui, expériemente dans cette pièce la relation réciproque entre l'acte dramatique et les harmonies tonales.

During these years, foes attacked this minor sect as a significant threat to the English church and state. The decline in the assault upon the Family has been attributed by many historians to a concurrent decline in the sect. However, recent research has demonstrated that the Family survived even after 1581, requiring a new explanation for the end of the attacks. The outburst of hostility was an element in a wider struggle for political influence which began with the fall of Archbishop Grindal in 1577. Puritans sought to magnify the threat posed by the apparently Catholic Family to indirectly assail their conservative enemies. The attacks ended not because of the elimination of the Family, but due to a political shift which allowed conservatives to silence their puritan foes.

Considered by its author "the most violent and bizarre" of the Rabbit Angstrom tetralogy, Rabbit Redux fuses history and fiction in an apocalyptic narrative. Using the original 1971 hardback cover (with a background of red, grey and blue stripes) as its starting point, this essay focuses on the semiotic use of chromatic values and color imagery that transforms this chronicle of troubled times into a visionary happening: first, the fading of the starless banner in the spectral blankness of this summer of the moon; then the transformation of the green pastures of America into the deathly emblem of a world at war, at home and abroad; and finally the crossing of the color line in which the black man becomes the white of the page. The novel's ambiguity culminates in an open, suspended, interrogative ending which maintains the reader in the grey zone of an unstable and complex truth.

Evolutionary, cultural, and popular literature on love suggests that males and female differ in their conception of romantic love and its relation to sex. But what is the relationship (if any) in similarities and differences between these national cultures and between genders. Research results showed a strong overall agreement on a common core that includes altruism, intrusive thinking, and emotional fulfillment. Also, there were national and gender differences, with nation having a stronger effect on the conception of romantic love than does gender.

A number of types of metaphors are identified and their source domains highlighted. Many of these metaphors involve the concept of 'ofa 'love' and related concepts like faka 'apa 'apa 'respect'. The metaphor analysis reveals a comprehensive organizational structure for the domain of social relationships—a cultural model. This structure replicates the organization present in other domains of Tongan knowledge, providing further support for the hypothesis that a cultural model of radiality is the basis of the preferred Tongan way of mentally organizing knowledge.

Shemuel Han-Nagid is rightly considered to be one of the greatest Hebrew poets of Spain. As one of the earliest Hebrew poets on Spanish soil, his importance lies in his innovations and the expansion of existing forms in the field of Hebrew poetry. The contributions of R. Shemuel Han-Nagid are manifold: 1) In content — war and ethical poems. 2) In form — various meters and a variety of poetic patterns. 3) In language — originality in style and numerous new expressions and word-forms. The secular themes of the poets who preceded him were strengthened and perfected in the poetry of R. Shemuel Han-Nagid, several of them becoming the accepted standard, and no further innovations introduced in these afterwards. This article is devoted to a study of the love poetry of R. Shemuel Han-Nagid, one of the themes demonstrating his contribution to medieval Hebrew poetry in Spain. It is the author's premise that the love theme, being a secular motif par excellence, has been greatly influenced by Arabic poetry. As an introduction to his comparison of Han-Nagid's love poetry with this theme in medieval Arabic poetry, the author reviews Hebrew love poetry as composed in Spain prior to the era of R. Shemuel Han-Nagid. He also surveys the appearance of this theme in the Arabic poetry of previous periods. A summary of Han-Nagid's love poems shows that they completely fit the accepted conventions of Arabic love poetry: the unfortunate lover tormented by his love, and the cruel beloved who makes her lovers suffer and derives enjoyment from their distress. The character of "the adorer" and "the adored" are so completely removed from one another that the relationship between them can best be characterized as one of opposites. The author presents parallels to thirty-two similes and ideas foreign to traditional Hebrew poetry which were borrowed by R. Shemuel Han-Nagid from Arabic poetry. These parallels are derived from the lyrics of the classical poets during the Abbasid period and the Arab poets (including Spaniards) contemporary with R. Shemuel Han-Nagid. Presentation of the parallel material from Arabic sources clarifies some strange phenomena and obscure passages which have hitherto prevented full appreciation of Han-Nagid's poetry. On the other hand, they testify to the powerful influence of Arabic literature upon contemporary Hebrew poets within the sphere of secular poetry.

It focuses particularly on a utopian vision detailed in a speech, “The Elixir of Life,” that Woodhull addressed to the tenth annual meeting of the American Association of Spiritualists, in which Woodhull predicted a swiftly arriving millennium that would unite heaven and earth, bringing eternal life to the living and restoring the dead to an earthly but perfect existence. This millennial vision centered on the perfectability of the human body at the intersection of the discourses of medicine, politics, and religion. This utopia would be ushered in by society's embracing of the principles of Free Love, the reform movement that espoused that emotional and physical romantic relations should be governed by mutual love alone without interference from legal or religious authority.   This speech is read against the backdrop of contemporaneous social movements in Spiritualism, Free Love, and alternative forms of medicine. The article argues that Woodhull defied both normative Christianity and the mainstream of Spiritualist believers by refusing to subordinate the body to the soul. The millennial impulse toward progress, seen so keenly in Spiritualist circles, was transformed here to refer to the individual rather than society at large. Social perfection would follow corporeal perfection. Arguing for a natural immortality of the body, Woodhull maintained an essential union and interreliance between the body and soul rather than a disjuncture between them.

Barley	Administrative Science Quarterly	42	4	1997-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 619-653	Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Sage Publications, Inc.	fla		This study examines how occupational mandates-the socially conferred right to perform a given set of tasks-are negotiated by nascent occupations. Because researchers typically examine occupational formation long after it has begun, they neglect activities that occur prior to the acquisition of key institutional supports. The commodification of work is one such activity. Work becomes a commodity when audiences deem a formerly unpaid activity worthy of remuneration. This study draws on ethnographic data to examine the strategic patterns of situated activity and interaction used by one fledgling occupation, emergency medical services, to convince key audiences that their work is indeed worthy of compensation. Strategies used to construct and communicate in situ impressions of expertise, consistency, fungibility, and contractual relations are examined. The results of the study shed light on the interactional foundation of institutionalization.

Writing as the father of a fourteen-year-old daughter with multiple disabilities, I will explore some of moral issues that arise here, both from the point of view of the disabled child and from that of the child's caretaker(s).

Taylor's concern is not only that we make such a commitment but that we make it in such a way that we avoid its ability to lead us towards injustice rather than justice. After articulating conceptions of love, justice, and injustice, the author turns to Charles Dickens's treatment of love and injustice in Bleak House, to explore more fully how love can lead to injustice, and also its potential role in promoting justice. Dickens's view, profoundly shaped by his own sense of Christian virtues, helps us see the inner workings of love, justice, and injustice, so that we can appreciate their interconnectedness anew and understand better the urgency of Taylor's question for our time.

This article studies its narrative time-structure and examines its arguments, and asks what each of these aspects of the text can tell us about the other. Breton's theoretical claims are put in conversation with some key texts of later Marxist thought, and Mad Love's story of prophecy and self-interpretation is read as a way of thinking about time.

Poska	Journal of Social History	29	4	1996-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 871-882	Oxford University Press	fla		In order to assert greater control over its parishioners, the Catholic Reformation Church in the wake of the Council of Trent (147-1563) attempted to bring relationships, especially those involving sexual relations, under its purview. This process involved the redefinition of marriage rituals, especially in terms of premarital sexual relations and the legitimization of marriage promises by a priest. The Council also strongly reiterated Church doctrine concerning the indissolubility of the sacrament of marriage. However, parishioners often proved to have little enthusiasm for such ecclesiastical regulation. I examined a variety of parish marriage records from 1550 to 1700 from the diocese of Ourense, a rural diocese in Galicia in northwestern Spain. A close look reveals that, despite the injunctions of the Council of Trent, not all promises of marriage and sexual activity led to marriage principally because local religious culture tolerated extra-marital sexuality. Moreover, from time to time even married couples separated and began new lives with new partners despite the ecclesiastical prohibitions. Contrary to historians' claims about the permanence of marriage in early modern Europe, the peasants of northwestern Spain maintained their traditional, more flexible notions of marriage throughout the seventeenth century.

Ralegh's immediate debt is to part of a long poem by Philippe Desportes, 'Contr'amour' (Les amours de Diane I), in a text dating to between 1573 and 1579. His adaptation of Desportes aggressively boils down an extensive anthology of Petrarchist tropes into a single act of valediction. Desportes's lines, in turn, derive from an Italian poem of uncertain authorship, 'Là've l'aurora' (first printed in 1553), which Ralegh may also have known. Ralegh's indebtedness to Desportes proves that his poem was composed before 'Most welcome love', a 'companion poem' to 'Farewell false love' written by Sir Thomas Heneage. The Ralegh-Desportes link, though, is less useful in adjudicating between the various theories that have been put forward to explain the existence of three different states of Ralegh's poem. Connections between 'Là've l'aurora', Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier, and Pietro Bembo, meanwhile, allow 'Farewell false love' to be read as a complicated response to Castiglione's depiction of Bembo's Neoplatonic view of love.

Section C: Archaeology, Celtic Studies, History, Linguistics, Literature	110C		2010-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 217-237	Royal Irish Academy	fla		This article is based on the unpublished papers of the American historian Walter D. Love, retained in the Department of Manuscripts, Trinity College Dublin. Prior to his death in 1966, Love was writing a study of the contested historiography of the Irish rebellion of 1641. This article attempts to reconstruct Love's broad overview of the significance of 1641 from the seventeenth century to the twentieth and his efforts to overcome the methodological problems that the writing of such a study posed. Arising from this, it also attempts to reconstruct the framework of the book that Love was writing at the time of his death. In doing so, this article is intended to contribute to ongoing debates about the nature and significance of the rebellion by examining Love's pioneering but sadly unfinished attempt to examine its legacy.

Bacon's reflections on eros come in two stages. He first examines the human and moral meaning of love. Bacon attends to the exorbitant promises of love—to bring us into a perfect condition, to grant us eternity—and finds them confused or unreasonable. Bacon then moves away from an engagement with the simple experiences of love and their promises. Departing from the human perspective, he proceeds to examine love, from the point of view of natural science or cosmology, as a fundamental property or principle of matter. This departure tends to lead, at least in the case of Bacon's followers, if not in Bacon's own case, to an obliviousness to both his cynical and appreciative insights into love.
